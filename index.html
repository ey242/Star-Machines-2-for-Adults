            <h2>Key information</h2>
            <ul style="text-align: left;">
                <li>You are being invited to participate in a research study. Participation in research is completely voluntary.</li>
                <li>The purpose of the study is to examine how adults infer and interpret cause and effect and how adults understand the thoughts and feelings of other people.</li>
                <li>The study will take a total of 1-4 testing sessions (but usually it is just one session) that will last no longer than 30 minutes each and you will be asked to play interactive games designed for both kids and adults. Sometimes you may receive payment incentives based on your choices, responses, or decisions. You may be asked to watch a short video clip, look at pictures, or listen to music, and you may be asked to answer questions about how the clip or music made you feel.</li>
                <li>Risks and/or discomforts may include the risk of breach of confidentiality.</li>
                <li>There is no direct benefit to you. The results from the study may contribute to improving our understanding of the way people make judgments about cause and effect.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Purpose of the Study</h2>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
                Dear Participant,<br>
                This study is being conducted by Alison Gopnik, professor of psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, and her laboratory of research assistants, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows. We invite you to participate in a study of how adults infer and interpret cause and effect and how adults understand the thoughts and feelings of other people. Please read the following information carefully and select the button below indicating whether you wish to participate in the study. Participation is entirely voluntary. If anything is not clear, please do not hesitate to ask questions.
            </p>

            <h2>Study Procedures</h2>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
                There can be up to 4 testing sessions (but usually it is just one session) that will last no longer than 30 minutes each. This study is designed to test hypotheses about the way people make judgments about cause and effect in a variety of contexts and about other peoples’ minds and behavior.<br><br>
                You may be asked to do one or more of the following tasks 1) causal learning tasks (e.g., figuring out what causes what), 2) linguistic tasks (e.g., word associations and learning), 3) imagination tasks (e.g., reasoning about events counter to fact), 4) categorization/ association tasks (e.g., grouping objects or stating what comes to mind given a prompt), 5) general cognitive tasks (e.g., impulse control and searching for hidden objects). You may be asked to make judgments about what you see, answer questions about your judgments (such as making predictions and providing explanations), observe events, and perform actions yourself (such as grouping objects or making machines activate). Sometimes you might watch a short video clip, look at pictures, or listen to music, and you may be asked to answer questions about how the clip or music made you feel.<br><br>
                You may refrain from answering any questions that make you uncomfortable and may withdraw your participation at any time even after completing the experiment without penalty.<br><br>
                This study contains a number of checks to make sure that participants are finishing the tasks honestly and completely. As long as you read the instructions and complete the tasks, your submission will be approved. If you fail these checks, your submission will be rejected and you will not be compensated for responses entered.<br><br>
                Study time: Your study participation will take a total of 1-4 testing sessions (but usually it is just one session) that will last no longer than 30 minutes each.<br><br>
                Study location: All study procedures will take place online.
            </p>

            <h2>Benefits</h2>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
                While there is no direct benefit to you, you may enjoy the novelty of our interactive displays. You will also be making a substantial contribution to improving our understanding of the way people make judgments about cause and effect.
            </p>

            <h2>Risks/Discomforts</h2>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
                We do not expect you to face any foreseeable risks from your participation. There is the unlikely possibility that your confidentiality will be compromised; however, we have taken measures to minimize this risk.
            </p>

            <h2>Confidentiality</h2>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
                Your identity will be separated from your data and a random numerical code will be assigned to keep track of the data. Your confidentiality will be kept to the degree permitted by the technology being used. No guarantees can be made regarding the interception of data sent via the Internet by any third parties. Data will be kept indefinitely. All information will be securely stored at the University in encrypted format. Physical data and information collected during the research will be encrypted and securely stored electronically both online and on an external hard drive as a back up. The external hard drive will be securely stored at the University in locked file cabinets, and housed in secure rooms. Only laboratory personnel will have access to this data. No individuals will be identified in any presentation or publication. Identifiers might be removed from the identifiable private information. After such removal, the information could be used for future research studies or distributed to other investigators for future research studies without additional informed consent from the subject or the legally authorized representative.<br><br>

                Your personal information may be released if required by law. Authorized representatives from the following organizations may review your research data for purposes such as monitoring or managing the conduct of this study:
                <li>Sponsors: National Science Foundation, Mind Science Foundation, Princeton University, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)</li>
                <li>University of California</li>
            </p>

            <h2>Costs of Study Participation</h2>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
                There are no costs associated with study participation.
            </p>

            <h2>Compensation</h2>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
                For your participation in our research, you will receive a minimum rate of $12 per hour. Payment ranges from $0.60 to $1 for a 5-minute task and from $4.00 to $6.00 for a 30-minute task, depending on the time it takes to complete the type of task you’ve been assigned. For studies on Prolific, you will receive a minimum rate of $8 per hour. For experiments with a differential bonus payment system you may have the opportunity to earn “points” that are worth up to 5 cents each, with a total bonus of no more than 30 cents paid on top of the flat fee paid for the task completion. Your online account will be credited directly.
            </p>

            <h2>Rights</h2>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
                Please understand that your participation in the research is voluntary and that you are free to withdraw your consent and discontinue participation in the research at any time. If you decide not to participate, there will be no penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.
